# cleanup

`crabbox cleanup` sweeps direct-provider leftovers.

```sh
crabbox cleanup --dry-run
crabbox cleanup
```

Cleanup refuses to run when a coordinator is configured. Brokered cleanup belongs to the Durable Object alarm.

Direct cleanup skips kept machines, deletes expired ready/leased/active machines, and gives running/provisioning machines an extra stale safety window. It relies on provider labels such as `lease`, `slug`, `expires_at`, and `state`.

Flags:

```text
--provider hetzner|aws|static-ssh
--dry-run
```

`crabbox machine cleanup` remains as a compatibility alias.
